      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This course is both a survey of computer law and an examination of how courts, juries, and administrative agencies make decisions on issues involving computer technology.&nbsp; It is also a survey of the most important and controversial topics in technology law today.&nbsp; The material is divided into six primary subjects: </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1. Legal process:</b> how courts operate, differences between civil and criminal law, who has to obey the determination of a court, over whom a court can exercise power, and regulatory law.&nbsp; <br>
        <b>2. Evidence:</b> what has to be proven to a court and how it is done, rules of evidence, burdens of proof, expert testimony.&nbsp; <br>
        <b>3. eBusiness Law:</b> software licenses, clickwrap contracts, electronic transactions. <br>
        <b> 4. Personal Intrusions: </b>social media, libel and defamation, data privacy, position monitoring.<br>
<b>5. Intellectual Property:</b> Trade secrets and confidentiality agreements.&nbsp; Copyright: fair use, software copyrights.&nbsp; Patents: what is patentable, how patents are obtained, software patents, Internet patents.&nbsp; <br>
<b>6. Government Regulation:</b> &nbsp;AI law and regulation, Net neutrality, antitrust principles, computer crime.</font></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">
      <p class="MsoNormal">No legal background is required or assumed.&nbsp; This is not a law school course.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Great effort is expended to keep the syllabus current based on breaking legal events.&nbsp; Therefore, the content and ordering of lectures may vary somewhat as the course progresses.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">NOTE: It is possible that the instructor may be
obliged to testify at one or more trials during the semester. Any missed lectures will be rescheduled or held remotely via Zoom.</p>
      <p><font color="#ff0000">
<b>Which Course Should I Take?</b></font></p>
      <p>All three courses meet in the same place at the same time.&nbsp; They differ only in course length, number of homwork assignments and number of credits awarded.</p>
      <p>17-762 is a 12-unit, full-semester course intended for
graduate students, particularly those in the MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation 
program and Societal Computing Ph.D. students.</p>
      <p>17-562 is a 9-unit, full-semester course intended for
undergraduates and graduate students outside of S3D.</p>
      <p>17-662 is a 6-unit minicourse offered in Fall Mini 1,
consisting of the first 14 lectures.&nbsp; It is required for students in the Privacy Engineering program.&nbsp; The requirement can also be satisfied with 17-562 or 17-762.&nbsp; Almost all students who register for 17-662 eventually switch into 17-562 or 17-762.&nbsp; However, except for MS in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation students, who must take 17-762, any student may register for any version of the course.</p>
      <p>Everyone in all three courses will take a take-home final examination.&nbsp; The final exam counts for 30% of the grade.&nbsp; There are no midterm exams. Class participation counts for 10%.&nbsp; Homework counts for 60%.&nbsp; There is one mini-homework 0 for everyone, then  4 more homeworks in 17-762, 3 in 17-562 and 2 in 17-662.</p></font>

      <p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="2">No textbook</font></b></p>
      <font face="Arial" size="2">
      <p>There is no textbook because the materials necessary for this course are very recent and have not yet found their way into
textbooks.&nbsp; All of the readings are available on the Internet, and will be posted approximately one month in advance.&nbsp; <b><font color="#ff0000">Readings are to be done BEFORE the associated lecture.</font></b>&nbsp;
PLEASE NOTE: readings for future lectures may change as the course progresses if warranted by significant legal decisions.&nbsp; So read ahead, but not too far ahead.</p>
      Advice on how to succeed in the course can be found in the Course <a href="http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/program/law/08-732/handbook.pdf">Handbook</a>. 
      <p>You may find the course <a href="http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/program/law/08-732/glossary.pdf">glossary</a>
        useful in understanding legal terminology and abbreviations.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#ff0000" face="Arial" size="2">Administrative Information</font></b></p>
      <p>The course meets twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursday 8:00-9:20 a.m.in Dougherty Hall A302, possibly occasionally via Zoom. </p>
      <p>Students are encouraged to work together on the homework assignments. Past experience has shown that students do better when they work in teams. However, after discussing problems and solutions jointly, each student must prepare their own paper individually, without copying material from other people.</p>
      <p>The final exam will be a take-home over a period of at least 24 hours, date to be determined. It will be open-book, open notes and open Internet. However, unlike with homework, collaboration with others is not permitted during the final exam.</p>

      <p>To ask a question or schedule an appointment outside of class,
please send email to <a href="mailto:shamos@cs.cmu.edu">shamos@cs.cmu.edu</a>.
      Questions of general interest to the class should be asked in class, not in email or in a private meeting.</p>
      <p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Grading Policy</b></font></p>
      <p>Written work will not be re-graded except for manifest error.&nbsp; A "manifest error" is one that is immediately apparent
from the paper itself, such as failure to grade a question or an arithmetic error in computing a score.</p>

rapidly, and statutes and
legal decisions can't keep up.&nbsp; This means that old laws are constantly being applied to situations not contemplated when the laws were originally passed.&nbsp; This means that a court must interpret the words of a statute in a new context, a process called statutory interpretation.&nbsp; This is not a haphazard process, but is guided by specific rules which, unfortunately, can produce anomalies to be remedied later by the legislature.&nbsp; We will look at interpretation of existing statutes in light of new technology not contemplated when the statutes were passed..

		  <b>11. DEFAMATION, FREE SPEEECH AND SECTION 230</b></font> <font size="2" face="Arial">(Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025) &#8211; With websites, Twitter, Facebook and other social media, everyone is now a publisher and, for that matter, an instant 
        publisher.&nbsp;This has given rise to fake news, doxing, revenge porn and other such acts. There has always been a tension between freedom of speech 
        and one's right not to be defamed or embarrassed through publication of false information (or wrongful revealing of true information).&nbsp; 
        Under the Communications Decency Act (Section 230), when is a website liable for the positings of its subscribers? Because the Internet is a worldwide medium, it is possible to cause great 
        damage in another country without leaving home, and, more important, without 
        subjecting oneself to the jurisdiction of foreign courts.&nbsp; Or is it?&nbsp; 
        Can imprudent social media posts be retracted so they cannot be used against 
        the poster in the future?&nbsp; Is it legal to collect a person's posts and 
        archive them, hoping to use them again the poster in the future?</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2">

In August, 2012, Apple won over $1 billion against Samsung for infringement of its patents on the iPhone user interface.&nbsp; We will study these cases in detail, including various decisions made by the courts and the juries.</font></p>

Because so many businesses are completely dependent on computers, servers have become a target for extortion attempts, competitive attacks, theft of trade secrets and hacking with a variety of objectives, some as simple as publicizing causes.&nbsp; The U.S. has been slow to cope with advancements in computer crime because of a fundamental principle of criminal law: crime statutes are strictly construed.&nbsp; Simply stated, this means that an act is not a crime unless a statute makes it explicitly criminal.&nbsp; There are no "common law" computer crimes.&nbsp; With legislatures slow to draft laws to keep pace with criminals, there is a continuing gap between what is legal and what should be illegal.&nbsp; The first lecture will
